# Repo
Pull the repo from this location: https://github.com/jarrettalexander77/OMSCS-7641-Assignment2.

This will contain both training scripts and the datasets chosen.

# Setup

I used anaconda to setup my environment for this project. As a prereq for this, all of the following packages will need setup.

- Jupyter Notebook
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Scikit Learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- mlrose_hiive

# Data
The wine dataset can be found in the data/ folder. However, if you wish to download this separately, it will need to be named winequality-red.csv in order to work with the notebooks. These can be acquired from the following links:
- Wine : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

# Running the Code
All development was completed in a jupyter notebook. There are 4 notebooks - NN.ipynb, One Max.ipynb, Queens Problem.ipynb, and TSP.ipynb. The first was used for training the NN and the rest for their respective problems.

These were modified heavily as testing went on. The final state should represent fairly closely the outputs in the paper.

These notebooks will generate all charts used in the report as well. They will be saved to your computer as you run them. If you want to generate all charts, you will have to update the size value.

# Notes
Some hp's were tested and not given extensive coverage in the report. This was simply due to the 10 page limit and you should see some of these in these notebooks.
